Content pages are mainly text based and are written in markdown.

To create a new content page, create a file, such as `my-new-page.md` and add the `layout: page` to the front matter.

```yaml
layout: page
title: My new page
```

Content pages can use [Related links](/components/related-links/) to link to related pages in the site.
