Set the layout of a landing page as `layout: landing-page` in the page's front matter.

Landing pages can use [Section links](/components/section-links/) to link to other pages in the site. An example of section links with images is shown below.

Also take a look at the [Hero image](/components/hero-image/) for how you can enhance the hero image with text and a call to action.
