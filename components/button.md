A button component is used as a call to action link that stands out from a normal text link.

You can include the button as follows, passing in the name for the button text and the link:

{% raw %}

```liquid
{% include button.html name="View components" link="/components/" %}
```

{% endraw %}

This will output the following:

{% include button.html name="View components" link="/components/" %}
